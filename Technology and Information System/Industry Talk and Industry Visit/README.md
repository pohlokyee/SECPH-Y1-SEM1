<h2>Reflectionüí≠</h2>

**Summary**‚úçÔ∏è

Reflecting on the industry visits and talks during the first semester, I had the invaluable opportunity to explore and gain insights into the real-world applications of the concepts learned in the classroom. The visits to Huawei, Petronas, and UTM Digital UTM Johor broadened my perspective and understanding of technological innovation with their knowledge and high-tech product sharing session. Me and my friends are able to have a sight on real machine and interact directly with professionals and experts that provide us invaluable knowledge. The industry talks gave an opportunity to ask questions and gain insight into various perspectives related to our course subject. I had gain many useful information and advised from the speakers.These experiences have been invaluable in terms of enhancing my knowledge of data engineering beyond the theoretical framework.

**Assignment 1** - Information Communication Technology (ICT) is essential to play a meaningful role in industry as it makes a business more efficient, effective and promptly respond to customers' needs. Both talks were extremely helpful, and I'm confident that the knowledge and information gained will be invaluable in my future endeavors. In fact, I have been exploring various computer languages and systems to meet different skill requirements, which has helped motivate me to learn new things. I have plan to develop my problem-solving skills and enhance my ability to work in a team by solving the tasks that assigned by lecturers and attend the extra workshop.

**Assignment 2** - Visiting the the organization and attending the talk definitely improves our understanding and learning of the course material. We are able to have a sight on real machine and interact directly with professionals and experts that provide us invaluable knowledge and real-world applications of course concept. Attending talks also foster a collaborative learning environment in which we can interact with experts and friends, ask questions, and learn about different perspective on our course subject. This hands-on experience and exposure to industry practices complement theoretical learning, making the learning process more comprehensive and applicable to real-world scenario.

**Assignment 3** - Lifelong learning is vital to stay revelant to the fast-paced changes in technology, especially in the field ofcomputer science. I will always stay up to date with the latest developments in technology and focus on my degree studies to strengthen my foundation in programming and software development. Attending to the conferences and looking for entry-level jobs where I can connect with other experts and developers will be a part of my plan to gain more practical experience and theoretical knowledge.


**Assignment 4** - Both talks broadened my perspective and understanding of technological innovation with their knowledge and high-tech product sharing session. The advancement of technology made me realize how important it is for us to keep improving in order to keep up with technological changes. The benefits of technological advancements are numerous, ranging from increased efficiency and productivity to improved communication and collaboration. It had change the way we behave and operate that bring us a better quality of life. I will keep strengthen and solidify my knowledge to contribute to science and technology in the future.

**Suggestion**üí°

The industry visit to Huawei at Kuala Lumpur was time limited as their lunch time peak hour was nearby, causing that we are unable to have more time to thorough thier technologies and facilities. I do hope we are able to visit them again and have a longer time for us to have more sharing from the experts.

**Additional Comment**üìù
Please have more industry visit!!!! It's fun and the most important is we can get more additional knowledge from them.
