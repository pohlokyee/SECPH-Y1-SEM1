**Summary**‚úçÔ∏è

Assembling a PC provides a hands-on learning opportunity to us about the various components that make up a computer. We are able to have a deeper understanding on the roles of the CPU, RAM, motherboard, storage, and power supply.This also enhances our problem-solving skills and boosts confidence in dealing with computer's technical issues.
Here is the common steps to reassemble the computer :
1) Open Case
2) Disconnect Cable
3) Take Off Power Supply
4) Take Off RAM
5) Take Off HDD
6) Take Off CPU Fan
   

**Suggestion**üí°

We can conduct more of this type of hands-on experience because it allows us to gain practical experience in developing technical skills related to hardware components, their functions, and the computer's overall architecture.
