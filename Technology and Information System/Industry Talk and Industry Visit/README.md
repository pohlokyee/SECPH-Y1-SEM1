<h2>Reflection💭</h2>

**Summary**✍️

Reflecting on the industry visits and talks during the first semester, I had the invaluable opportunity to explore and gain insights into the real-world applications of the concepts learned in the classroom. The visits to Huawei, Petronas, and UTM Digital UTM Johor broadened my perspective and understanding of technological innovation with their knowledge and high-tech product sharing session. Me and my friends are able to have a sight on real machine and interact directly with professionals and experts that provide us invaluable knowledge. The industry talks gave an opportunity to ask questions and gain insight into various perspectives related to our course subject. I had gain many useful information and advised from the speakers.These experiences have been invaluable in terms of enhancing my knowledge of data engineering beyond the theoretical framework.

**Suggestion**💡

The industry visit to Huawei at Kuala Lumpur was time limited as their lunch time peak hour was nearby, causing that we are unable to have more time to thorough thier technologies and facilities. I do hope we are able to visit them again and have a longer time for us to have more sharing from the experts.

**Additional Comment**📝
Please have more industry visit!!!! It's fun and the most important is we can get more additional knowledge from them.
