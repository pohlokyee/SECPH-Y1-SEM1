**Summary**‚úçÔ∏è

This project has improved my communication and problem-solving abilities because it allows us to work in small groups.I do expose to a new sea of knowledge which have motivate me to discover more about computer science‚Äôs facts and information.In addition, I have learned how the Internet of Things (IOT) is developed into products by solving real-world problems that our interviewee brought up. I've learned from the prototyping process that creating a product is not a simple task. I will therefore continue honing my creative abilities in order to be able to come up with solutions for more issues that arise in our daily lives.

**Suggestion**üí°

All in all, this project is helpful to us since it allows us to develop a product that allows us to handle the problems on our own. I look forward to seeing the prototypes will become a real product that can be used by everyone. This will be a big achievement for us.


**Additional Comment**üìù
Giving students the opportunity to interview professionals was a great method to help them gain a deeper understanding of the course material and the particular subjects covered. This is an effective teaching method that helps students broaden their knowledge and enhance their communication abilities. I like this kind of learning.
