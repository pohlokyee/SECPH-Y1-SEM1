<h2>Reflection</h2>

Reflecting on the industry visits and talks during the first semester, I had the invaluable opportunity to explore and gain insights into the real-world applications of the concepts learned in the classroom. The visits to Huawei, Petronas, and UTM Digital UTM Johor broadened my perspective and understanding of technological innovation with their knowledge and high-tech product sharing session. Me and my friends are able to have a sight on real machine and interact directly with professionals and experts that provide us invaluable knowledge. The industry talks gave an opportunity to ask questions and gain insight into various perspectives related to our course subject. I had gain many useful information and advised from the speakers.These experiences have been invaluable in terms of enhancing my knowledge of data engineering beyond the theoretical framework. Observing the practical applications in various industries has motivated me to adopt a more practical and industry-focused approach to my studies.
